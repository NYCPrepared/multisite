This plugin provides 2 new tag types for the Contact Form 7 Plugin. It allows the dynamic generation of content for a text input box via any shortcode.
It also offers dynamic hidden field functionality, which can be utilized to dynamically set the Email Recipient (To:) address. 

== Description ==

Contact Form 7 is an excellent WordPress plugin, and the CF7 DTX Plugin makes it even more awesome by adding dynamic content capabilities.
While default values in Contact Form 7 are static. CF7 DTX lets you create pre-populated fields based on other values.  Some examples might include:

* Auto-filling a URL
* Auto-filling a Post ID, title, or slug
* Pre-populating a Product Number
* Referencing other content on the site
* Populating with post info 
* Populating with user info
* Populating with custom fields
* Any value you can write a shortcode for

There are many more case-specific examples. I searched for a solution, and there are some decent hacks out there. Many of them are 
explored in this forum topic: 
[Contact Form 7 Input Fields Values as PHP Get-Viarables](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/contact-form-7-input-fields-values-as-php-get-viarables). 
However, they all involved hacking the current Contact Form 7 code, which means next time the plugin is updated their edits will be 
overwritten. That's bad.

This Dynamic Text Extension plugin provides a more elegant solution that leaves the Contact Form 7 Plugin intact.

= WHAT DOES IT DO? =

This plugin provides a new tag type for the Contact Form 7 Plugin. It allows the dynamic generation of content for a text input box via any shortcode. 
For example, it comes with several built-in shortcodes that will allow the Contact Form to be populated from any $_GET PHP variable or any info from the 
get_bloginfo() function, among others.  See below for included shortcodes.

= HOW TO USE IT =

After installing and activating the plugin, the Contact Form 7 tag generator will have 2 new tag types: Dynamic Text Field and Dynamic Hidden Field. Most of the options will be 
familiar to Contact Form 7 users. There are two important fields:

**Dynamic Value**

This field takes a shortcode, with two important provisions:

1. The shortcode should NOT include the normal square brackets ([ and ]). So, instead of [CF7_GET key='value'] you would use CF7_GET key='value' .
2. Any parameters in the shortcode must use single quotes. That is: CF7_GET key='value' and not CF7_GET key="value"
	
	
**Uneditable Option**

As these types of fields should often remain uneditable by the user, there is a checkbox to turn this option on (Not applicable for hidden fields).


= INCLUDED SHORTCODES =

The plugin includes 2 basic shortcodes for use with the Dynamic Text extension. You can write your own as well - any shortcode will work

**PHP GET Variables**

Want to use a variable from the PHP GET array? Just use the CF7_GET shortcode. For example, if you want to get the foo parameter from the url 
http://mysite.com?foo=bar

Enter the following into the "Dynamic Value" input

CF7_GET key='foo'

Your Content Form 7 Tag will look something like this:

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_GET key='foo'"]

Your form's dynamicname text input will then be pre-populated with the value of foo, in this case, bar


**PHP POST Variables**

New in version 1.0.3!

Grab variables from the $_POST array.  The shortcode is much like the GET shortcode:

CF7_POST key='foo'

Your Content Form 7 Tag will look something like this:

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_POST key='foo'"]


**Blog Info**

Want to grab some information from your blog like the URL or the sitename? Use the CF7_bloginfo shortcode. For example, to get the site's URL:

Enter the following into the "Dynamic Value" input

CF7_bloginfo show='url'

Your Content Form 7 Tag will look something like this:

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_bloginfo show='url'"]

Your form's dynamicname text input will then be pre-populated with your site's URL


**Post Info**

New in version 1.0.3!

Retrieve information about the current post/page (that the contact form is displayed on).  The shortcode works as follows:

CF7_get_post_var key='title'      <-- retrieves the Post's Title
CF7_get_post_var key='slug'       <-- retrieves the Post's Slug

You can also retrieve any parameter from the $post object.  Just set that as the key value, for example 'post_date'

The Contact Form 7 Tag would look like:

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_get_post_var key='title'"]

**Current URL**

New in version 1.0.3!

Retrieve the current URL.  The shortcode takes no parameters:

CF7_URL

So your Contact Form 7 Tag would look like:

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_URL"]

**Custom Fields**

New in version 1.0.4!

Retrieve custom fields from the current post/page.  Just set the custom field as the key in the shortcode.

The dynamic value input becomes:

CF7_get_custom_field key='my_custom_field'

And the tag looks like this:

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_get_custom_field key='my_custom_field'"]

For the purposes of including an email address, you can obfuscate the custom field value by setting obfuscate='on' in the shortcode.

**Current User Info**

Get data about the current user - assuming they are logged in.  Defaults to user name, but you can set the key to any valid value in 
http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/get_currentuserinfo 

CF7_get_current_user

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_get_current_user"]

**Referrer URL**

Get the referral URL, if it exists.  Note that this is not necessarily reliable as not all browsers send this data.

[dynamictext dynamicname "CF7_referrer"]
