 Installing the plugin:
 ======================================================================================
  Please upload the complete plugin folder /cforms/, contained in this zip file, to
  your WP plugin directory!

  If there is no /cforms/ root folder in this zip file, please create one in your
  WordPress plugins/ folder.


 ======================================================================================
 Upgrading the plugin:
 ======================================================================================
        v9.0+ introduces a completely new method of storing its settings,
            ***** please make a WP database backup first (!) *****
        and then migrate your settings (cforms will provide guidance!)

  Then commence with a manual upgrade, including proper plugin deactivation and
  reactivation, followed by the guided data migration.


 ======================================================================================
 Did you modify any cforms theme (CSS) files, images etc?
 ======================================================================================
  Create a custom folder under /plugins/ & call it "/cforms-custom/". Move all your
  custom files into it. This folder will protect your changes going forward.

  Also note that it is always advisable to make or keep a backup of your
  current plugin directory just in case you need to revert back to a
  previous release!
