* Bug fix for the PHP Fatal error: Call to undefined function is_plugin_active_for_network(). It may take place under multisite only,

= 4.17 =
* 01.10.2014
* Multisite (update for cases when URE was not network activated): It is possible to use own settings for single site activated instances of User Role Editor. 
  Earlier User Role Editor used the settings values from the main blog only located under "Network Admin - Settings".
  Some critical options were hidden from the "Multisite" tab for single site administrators and visible to the superadmin only. 
  Single site admin should not have access to the options which purpose is to restrict him.
  Important! In case you decide to allow single site administrator activate/deactivate User Role Editor himself, setup this PHP constant at the wp-config.php file:
  define('URE_ENABLE_SIMPLE_ADMIN_FOR_MULTISITE', 1);
  Otherwise single site admin will not see User Role Editor in the plugins list after its activation. User Role Editor hides itself under multisite from all users except superadmin by default.
