== Description ==

The Options Framework Plugin makes it easy to include an options panel in any WordPress theme.  It was built so developers can concentrate on making the actual theme rather than spending time creating an options panel from scratch.  It's free to use in both commercial and personal projects, just like WordPress itself.

= Options Include =

* text input
* textarea
* checkbox
* select
* radio button
* upload (image uploader)
* images (use images instead of radio buttons)
* background (a set of options to define a background)
* multicheck
* color (a jquery color picker)
* typography (a set of options to define typography)
* editor

= Learn More =

Please visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin) for a full description of how to define and use the theme options.

== Installation ==

If your theme already has options enabled, they will show up under the appearance menu.

If your theme doesn't have options, you can define them to options.php of your theme and they will instantly show up.  For more on how to do this, visit [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I build options for my own theme? =

Download the development version from GitHub [https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-plugin](https://github.com/devinsays/options-framework-plugin) and copy the "options-check" folder into your themes directory.

The "Options Check" theme is a blueprint for how to work with options.  It includes an example of every option available in the panel and sample output in the theme.

You can also watch the video screencast I have at [http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin](http://wptheming.com/options-framework-plugin).
