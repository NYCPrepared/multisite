* Manage, Edit, and Export form user submissions.
* Save fields as favorites and re-use them in multiple forms.
* Export and Import forms and favorite fields.

*Changes:*

* Submission emailing has been moved to the ninja_forms_post_process hook from the ninja_forms_process hook.

= 2.2.1 =

*Changes:*

* Added a new action hook that runs if a form is set to "Require Logged-In", but the user is not logged in. It is named: ninja_forms_display_user_not_logged_in.

= 2.2.0 =

*Features:*

* Added a new form setting to prevent non-logged-in users from viewing or submitting the form.
* Added a new filter named: ninja_forms_display_show_form. It is passed $display, a bool() true or false, along with the form_id. It expects a bool() true or false return.

Ninja Forms now sets a $_SESSION variable, $_SESSION['ninja_forms_values'], equal to an array that looks like: array( 'field_id' => 32, 'user_value' => 'whatever the user submitted' ) just before it redirects. The target page can access these variables for processing or display.

*Changes:*

* Increased the max file size for form imports.
* Added a filter: ninja_forms_field_wrap_class. This filter is sent a string that contains the wrap class for each field along with its field id.
