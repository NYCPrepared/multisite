    /**
     * Why this function? It is meant to do what wp_die() does. But in
     * Ajax mode, wp_die just does die(-1). But in this plugin we are leveraging
     * Ajax mode to put in URL hooks to do exports. So it is not really making a in-page
     * call to the url, the full page is navigating to it, then it downloads a CSV file for
     * example. So if there are errors we want the wp_die() error page. So this
     * function is a copy of wp_die without the Ajax mode check.
     * @static
     * @param string $message HTML
     * @param string $title HTML Title
     * @param array $args see wp_die
     * @return void
     */
