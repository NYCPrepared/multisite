Saves submitted form data to the database and provides short codes to display it. Captures data from Contact Form 7 and Fast Secure Contact Form

== Description ==

This "CFDB" plugin saves contact form submissions to your WordPress database and provides short codes to retrieve and display the data.

By simply installing the plugin, it will automatically begin to capture submissions from:

* JetPack Contact Form plugin
* Contact Form 7 (CF7) plugin
* Fast Secure Contact Form (FSCF) plugin

Other form submissions can be saved with the addition of the <a href="http://cfdbplugin.com/?page_id=508">[cfdb-save-form-post]</a> short code on the target submission page.

Contact form plugins are great but generally one thing...the ability to save and retrieve the form data to/from the database.
If you get a lot of form submissions, then you end up sorting through a lot of email.

Looking at your data in the WP Admin Area

This plugin provides three administration pages in the administration area under the "Contact form DB" submenu.

* "Contact form DB" to view and export form submission data
* "Database Short Code" page to generate short codes and export
* "Database Options" to change configuration parameters

Displaying Saved Data in Posts and Pages

Use short codes such as [cfdb-html], [cfdb-table], [cfdb-datatable], [cfdb-value] and [cfdb-json] to display the data on a non-admin page on your site.
Use the short code builder page to set short code options.

Disclaimer: I am not the maker of JetPack, Contact Form 7 nor Fast Secure Contact Form and am not associated with the development of those plugins.

== Installation ==

1. Your WordPress site must be running PHP5 or better. This plugin will fail to activate if your site is running PHP4.
1. Be sure that any of Contact Form 7, Fast Secure Contact Form and/or JetPack is installed and activated (this is an extension to them)
1. Fast Secure Contact Form should be at least version 2.9.7

Notes:

* Tested using PHP 5.2.13, MySQL 5.0 (Using 1and1 for hosting)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I installed the plugin but I don't see any of my forms listed in the administration page =
Nothing will show until you have actual form submissions captured by this plugin. The plugin is not aware of your form definitions, it is only aware of form submissions.

= Where can I find documentation on the plugin? =
Refer the <a href="http://cfdbplugin.com/">Plugin Site</a>


= Where do I see the data? =

* Contact Form 7 Users: In the admin page, under CF7's top level "Contact" admin menu. Look for "Contact" -> "Database"
* Fast Secure Contact Form Users: In the admin page, Plugins -> FS Contact Form Option, There is a "Database" link at the top of the page
* For a direct link, use http://&lt;your-wordpress-site&gt;/wp-admin/admin.php?page=CF7DBPluginSubmissions

= Can I display form data on a non-admin web page or in a post? =

Yes, <a href="http://cfdbplugin.com/?page_id=89">documentation on shortcodes</a> `[cfdb-html]`, `[cfdb-datatable]`, `[cfdb-table]`, `[cfdb-json]` and `[cfdb-value]`, etc.

= What is the name of the table where the data is stored? =

`wp_cf7dbplugin_submits`
Note: if you changed your WordPress MySql table prefix from the default `wp_` to something else, then this table will also have that prefix instead of `wp_` (`$wpdb->prefix`)
Note: previous to version 2.0, the table was named "wp_CF7DBPlugin_SUBMITS" but was changed to all-lowercase as part of the 2.0 upgrade.

= If I uninstall the plugin, what happens to its data in the database? =

By default it remains in your database in its own table. There is an option to have the plugin delete all its data if you uninstall it that you can set if you like.
You can always deactivate the plugin without loosing data.
