== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I change the look of forms? =

The same way you would change the look of anything else on your site: CSS. Theme My Login uses it's own very basic stylesheet.
You can copy this to your theme's directory and add additional styling there or simply add additional styling to your theme's stylesheet.

= I can't get into my site! What do I do? =

Visit yoursite.com/wp-login.php.

= What happened to the language folder? =

As of version 6.3, Theme My Login no longer ships with translation files. Translations will be available at http://downloads.jfarthing.com.

= How do I obtain additional assistance? =

Please visit http://www.jfarthing.com/development/theme-my-login first and then visit http://www.jfarthing.com/support if you have any questions, concerns, suggestions or problems.
