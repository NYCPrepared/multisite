== Description ==

This plugin lets you hide custom menu items based on user roles.  So if you have a link in the menu that you only want to show to logged in users, certain types of users, or even only to logged out users, this plugin is for you.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Appearance > Menus
1. Edit the menu items accordingly.  First select whether you'd like to display the item to all logged in users, all logged out users or to customize by role.
1. If you chose customize by role, then you you can check the boxes next to the roles you'd like to restrict visibility to.
1. If you choose 'By Role' and don't check any boxes, the item will be visible to everyone like normal.

== Screenshots ==

1. Show the new options for the menu items in the admin menu customizer

= I don't see the Nav Menu Roles options in the admin menu items?  =

This is likely because you have another plugin (or theme) that is also trying to alter the same code that creates the Menu section in the admin.  For example, the UberMenu Mega Menus plugin is a known conflict with Nav Menu Roles.

This is not a failure of Nav Menu Roles and there isn't anything I can do about it. WordPress does not have sufficient hooks in this area of the admin and until they do plugins are forced to replace everything via custom admin menu Walker, of which there can be only one. Until these hooks are added the menu modification plugins are unfortunately going to conflict with one another.

There's a possibility this will be added in WordPress 3.6
http://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18584

When/if it is, I will update Nav Menu Roles.

= 1.1 I'm using XYZ Membership plugin and I don't see its "levels"? =

There are apparently a few membership plugins out there that *don't* use traditional WordPress roles/capabilities. My plugin will list any role registered in the traditional WordPress way. If your membership plugin is using some other system, then Nav Menu Roles won't work with it out of the box.  Since 1.3.5 I've added a filter called `nav_menu_roles_item_visibility` just before my code decides whether to show/hide a menu item. There's also always been the `nav_menu_roles` filter which lets you modify the roles listed in the admin. Between these two, I believe you have enough to integrate Nav Menu Roles with any membership plugin. 

Here's an example where I've added a new pseudo role, creatively called "new-role".  The first function adds it to the menu item admin screen. The second function is pretty generic and won't actually do anything because you need to supply your own logic based on the plugin you are using.  Nav Menu Roles will save the new "role" info and add it to the item in an array to the `$item->roles` variable.

`
/*
 * Add custom roles to Nav Menu Roles menu list
 * param: $roles an array of all available roles, by default is global $wp_roles 
 * return: array
 */
function kia_new_roles( $roles ){
	$roles[] = 'new-role';
	return $roles;
}
add_filter( 'nav_menu_roles', 'kia_new_roles' );

/*
 * Change visibilty of each menu item
 * param: $visible boolean
 * param: $item object, the complete menu object. Nav Menu Roles adds its info to $item->roles
 * $item->roles can be "in" (all logged in), "out" (all logged out) or an array of specific roles
 * return boolean
 */
function kia_item_visibility( $visible, $item ){
	if( isset( $item->roles ) && is_array( $item->roles ) && in_array( 'new-role', $item->roles ) ){
	/*	if ( // your own custom check on the current user versus 'new-role' status ){
				$visible = true;
			} else {
				$visible = false;
		}
	*/	}
	return $visible;
}
add_filter( 'nav_menu_roles_item_visibility', 'kia_item_visibility', 10, 2 );

I can't provide free support for custom integration with a non-standard plugin. You may [contact me](http://kathyisawesome.com/contact) to discuss hiring me, or I would suggest using a plugin that supports WordPress' roles, such as Justin Tadlock's [Membership](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/membership).

= What happened to my menu roles on import/export? =

The Nav Menu Roles plugin stores 1 piece of post *meta* to every menu item/post.  This is exported just fine by the default Export tool.

However, the Import plugin only imports certain post meta for menu items.  As of version 1.3, I've added a custom Importer to Nav Menu Roles as a work around.

= How Do I Use the Custom Importer? =

1. Go to Tools>Export, choose to export All Content and download the Export file
1. Go to Tools>Import on your new site and perform your normal WordPress import
1. Return to Tools>Import and this time select the Nav Menu Roles importer.
1. Use the same .xml file and perform a second import
1. No duplicate posts will be created but all menu post meta (including your Nav Menu Roles info) will be imported
