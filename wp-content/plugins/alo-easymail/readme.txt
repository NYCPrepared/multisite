**Here you are a short screencast:** [How to create and send a newsletter](http://www.eventualo.net/blog/wp-alo-easymail-newsletter-guide/)

**Features:**

* **write and send html/text newsletters, simple like writing posts**: newsletter is a custom post type, using the standard WordPress GUI and API
* **select the recipients to send to**: registered users, subscribers, mailing lists
* **batch sending using WP cron system**: it sends a number of emails every 5 minutes, until all recipients have been included
* **collect subscribers**: on registration form and with an ajax widget/page
* **import/export subscribers**: import from existing registered users or from a CSV file
* **create and manage mailing lists**: only admin can assign subscribers to them, or subscribers can freely choose them
* **newsletter themes**: using html/php files in plugin or theme folder
* **manage subscribers**: search, delete, edit subscription to mailing lists 
* **manage capabilities**: choose the roles that can send newsletter, manage subscribers and settings
* **view sending report**: how many subscribers have opened the newsletter and clicked on links inside it
* **bounce management**: the bounced email addresses are automatically unsubscribed
* **multilanguage**: set all texts and options, you can write multilanguage newsletters - full integration with [WPML](http://wpml.org/), [qTranslate](http://wordpress.org/plugins/qtranslate/), [Polylang](http://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/)
* **debug tool**: rather than the recipients, you can send all emails of a newsletter to the author or you can have them recorded into a log file

**Internationalization**

*Available in more than 20 languages.*

You can add or update the translation in your language. To make the plugin package lighter you can find only the .MO files inside it.
You can visit the plugin [repository on Github](https://github.com/groucho75/alo-easymail/tree/master/languages) to look for the most updated language files (.MO and .PO files). You can share your updated translation files.
