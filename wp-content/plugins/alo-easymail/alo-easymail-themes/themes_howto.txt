                         =========================



HOW TO CREATE A THEME:
======================

- create an html or php theme file, called for example: 
  myname_mytheme.html
  
- if you need images for your theme, you have to store them in a 
  folder named as the html theme file, e.g.: 
  /myname_mytheme/

- the "src" attribute of <img> tag must include relative url to images, e.g.:
  <img src="myname_mytheme/image.jpg" />
  The plugin will replace automatically the theme folder name url 
  (e.g. "myname_mytheme") with the absolute url to theme folder
  (e.g. "http://yourblog.ltd/path/to/myname_mytheme"): so don't use a theme name 
  that contains your domain name or the replacement will break your images urls.
  
- to include the newsletter main content you must include the [CONTENT] tag
  into the html theme file

- then, you can use all placeholders available for newsletters
	
- you can look at default themes for inspiration and samples


	
TIP:
===

- Copy "alo-easymail-themes" folder into 'wp-content' or into your theme
  directory and edit your themes there. Useful to prevent the loss of
  themes when you upgrade the plugin.

- In Newsletters-> Settings->tab Newsletter you can disable/enable themes, or 
  force a specific theme as default.
