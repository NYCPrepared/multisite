Subtitles and notes can also be added to the form in any location.

= Publishing a Form =
Forms are placed within posts or pages.  Look for the Form Manager button in your post editor towards the right (Thanks to [Andrea Bersi](http://www.andreabersi.com)).  

You can also type in shortcodes yourself.  For example, if your form's slug is 'form-1', put the following within a post or page: 

`[form form-1]`
